# About Me
Hi there, I'm Alex (Also known as TheComputerGuy132 in some communities)  
I am a freelance Software Developer who enjoys tinkering with electronics and contributing to various open source projects in my free time.  

Some of the technologies that I enjoy using outside of work:  
Python  
Arduino  
Raspberry Pi  
3D Printers  

Some of the open source projects that I maintain:  
The [Display-ETA](https://github.com/AlexVerrico/Octoprint-Display-ETA) plugin for Octoprint  
The [Thermal Runaway](https://github.com/AlexVerrico/Octoprint-ThermalRunaway) plugin for Octoprint  


I love working on open source projects as it allows me to give back to the communities that have helped me so much along my open source journey  
  
Donating to me will help allow me to continue working on open source projects in my free time, no matter if you are buying me a coffee â˜• or dinner out, all of your support is greatly appreciated, as it helps me move towards my goal of working on open source full time.
